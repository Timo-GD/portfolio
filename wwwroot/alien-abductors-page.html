                    <br>
                    It was my first game made for the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
                    <br>
                    It uses the p5.js framework, which mostly uses javascript.
                    <br>
                    The goal of the game is to make sure the alien tanks do not cross the walls. The game was solely made by me in 46 days.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The making of the game introduced a lot of new ideas to me, like Object Oriented Programming and code conventions.
                    <br>
                    It is very rough around the edges but I learned a lot from it and it laid the foundation for where I am now so that I could become better with every project.
                    <br>
                    The main reason for this project being included in my portfolio is to showcase where I started and how progress and improvement I have made in the last year.
