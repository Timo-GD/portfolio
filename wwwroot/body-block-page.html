                Body block is a p5.js platformer. It was made together with Samuel Zwijsen.
                <br>
                <br>
                In the project I worked on the movement, collision and the body dropping and movement of the dropped bodies.
                <br>
                The most difficult part of this project was the movement and the collision script.
                <br>
                In the movement script the biggest challenge was the vertical movement and making it feel good for a platformer. To fix the vertical movement we used jump buffers and coyote time. We also used deceleration for the horizontal movement which helped with making the movement feel great.
                <br>
                The collision was a whole different problem. We eventually made a system that checked the closest tiles to the player and handled the collision of those tiles.
