                    Body block is a p5.js platformer. It was made together with Samuel Zwijsen.
                    <br>
                    The idea of body block is that you have to complete the level using the bodies of your old attempts. When you die your body stays in that place so that you can use it in your next attempt as an extra platform. Using this mechanic you have to solve the small puzzles per level to complete the level. Due to time constraint there are only two playable levels.

                    In the project I worked on the movement, collision and the body dropping and movement of the dropped bodies.
                    <br>
                    The most difficult part of this project was the movement and the collision script.
                    <br>
                    In the movement script the biggest challenge was the vertical movement and making it feel good for a platformer. To fix the vertical movement we used jump buffers and coyote time. We also used deceleration for the horizontal movement which helped with making the movement feel great.
                    <br>
                    The collision was a whole different problem. We eventually made a system that checked the closest tiles to the player and handled the collision of those tiles.
