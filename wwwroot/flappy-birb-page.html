            <p class="flappy-birb-description">
                Hold the Line was my first game made for the Amsterdam University of Applied Sciences.
                <br>
                It is made using the p5.js framework, which mostly uses javascript.
                <br>
                Hold the Line is a space invaders clone in which you have to make sure the alien tanks do not cross the walls. The game was solely made by me in 46 days.
                <br>
                In this project we were introduced to programming in javascript, Object Oriented Programming and scrum.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br>
                This project was my first exposure to game development, and for that reason it is still quite rough around the edges when it comes to code structure, readability and code conventions.
                <br> 
                However even this early project I am quite proud of because how the game plays, feels and looks still came out great.
                <br>
                 And most important of all I learned a lot during its development which increased my skills which I could put to good use in the later projects.
