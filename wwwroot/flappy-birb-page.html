                    Flappy Birb is a flappy bird clone made using the unity game engine. It was made in two weeks, solo.
                    <br>
                    The task that we were given to make the game was to make a 3D flappy bird. My take on this was making it a combination between subway surfers and flappy bird. You control the birdâ€™s height by jumping and can switch between left, right and middle to dodge pipes or go for easier targets.

                    <br>
                    The project was my first experience with the unity game engine. And with it came a lot of learning.
                    <br>
                    The most challenging part was learning unity. But through the help of the unity documentation and help from fellow students I learned.
                    <br>
                    The fact that I was discovering unity is also visible in the project due to the unnecessary build in features I use in the project.
